A value of 0 should be used if the given point-radius does not completely contain the original representation. The pointRadiusSpatialFit is undefined (and should be left blank) if the original representation is a point without uncertainty and the given georeference is not that same point (without uncertainty). If both the original and the given georeference are the same point, the pointRadiusSpatialFit is 1.

footprintSRS	http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/footprintSRS	A Well-Known Text (WKT) representation of the Spatial Reference System (SRS) for the footprintWKT of the Location. Do not use this term to describe the SRS of the decimalLatitude and decimalLongitude, even if it is the same as for the footprintWKT - use the geodeticDatum instead.	The WKT for the standard WGS84 SRS (EPSG:4326) is "GEOGCS["GCS_WGS_1984",DATUM["D_WGS_1984",SPHEROID["WGS_1984",6378137,298.257223563]],PRIMEM["Greenwich",0],UNIT["Degree",0.0174532925199433]]" without the enclosing quotes.	http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/index.htm#footprintSRS	string	false
footprintSpatialFit	http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/footprintSpatialFit	The ratio of the area of the footprint (footprintWKT) to the area of the true (original, or most specific) spatial representation of the Location.

A value of 0 should be used if the given footprint does not completely contain the original representation. The footprintSpatialFit is undefined (and should be left blank) if the original representation is a point and the given georeference is not that same point. If both the original and the given georeference are the same point, the footprintSpatialFit is 1.
