#Stream Monitoring Habiata Data Exchange Specifications 
Stream Monitoring Habitat Data Exchange Specifications is a standard for exchanging metric-level habitat data based on the Darwin Core principles. 

The stream habitat data exchange specifications are structured based on the simple Darwin Core standard. Using data from four federal stream habitat monitoring programs as a model, we outline the elements needed to share or integrate metrics from stream habitat data sets. We included core dataset information, location information, data collection event information, and individual metrics data. We follow the recommend Darwin Core star database schema due to how one location relates to multiple events, and programs produce numerous metrics at a single event (Figure 1) [Figure 1](Figures/Structure of Darwin Core for Habitat metrics.png). The approach is flexible enough to be adapted later to support the transfer of other data types such as macroinvertebrate counts or riparian vegetation.


If partners wish to exchange additional metrics, the controlled vocabulary needs to be updated  with the name, description, short machine-readable name, data type, and unit.  We use GitHub to manage version control of the habitat metric vocabulary.  To use the controlled vocabulary, a new program must cross-walk the fields in their datasets fields to the dictionary and document their data collection and analysis methods in MonitoringResources.org. The pilot program?s field cross-walk and MonitoringResources.org metrics IDs are shared in the cross-walk.csv file.
