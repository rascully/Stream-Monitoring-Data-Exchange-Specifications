# Stream Monitoring Habiata Data Exchange Specifications 
Stream Monitoring Habitat Data Exchange Specifications is a standard for exchanging metric-level habitat data based on the Darwin Core principles. 

The stream habitat data exchange specifications are structured based on the simple Darwin Core standard. Using data from four federal stream habitat monitoring programs as a model, we outline the elements needed to share or integrate metrics from stream habitat data sets. We included core dataset information, location information, data collection event information, and individual metrics data. We follow the recommend Darwin Core star database schema due to how one location relates to multiple events, and programs produce numerous metrics at a single event [Figure 1](Figures/StructureofStreamHabitatData.png). The approach is flexible enough to be adapted later to support the transfer of other data types such as macroinvertebrate counts or riparian vegetation.

We utilize the Darwin Core classes Record-level, Location, Occurrence, and Measurement or Fact [Figure 2](Figures/StructureOfDarwinCoreForHabitatMetrics.png). Class in Darwin Core is the title for a group of terms. Record-level class documents information about each dataset and is linked to Location using the DatasetID. Location class document the location and metadata about that location; it is associated with a sampling event using the LocationID. Multiple events can be related to one location—the Event class documents the data collection event and metadata about the sampling event. The event is linked to the specific metric using the EventID. The Measurement Or Fact class documents the metrics and metadata about each metric. At each event, programs collet multiple measurements, producing numerous metrics. To promote transparent and consistent metadata, we facilitated a process to describe a standard vocabulary defining the metrics that can be shared using these data exchange specifications. 

## Record Level Class 
The Record Level class documents the core elements of a data set, including information about the origin of the dataset, who collected the data, and how to cite the dataset [Table 1] ().  A data set is a collection of data collection events; for example, a program releases a data set every five years containing all the data collection events occurring in the previous five years. We recommend storing metadata in a trusted online data repository to ensure we have sufficient information about data sets’ origins. If a program does not have the resources to build a repository, we recommend using USGS ScienceBase, which is available to all.
