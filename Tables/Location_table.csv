2,2,"Location",NA,"locationID","This is the location identification for the integrated data set the value is the concatenation of the verbatimlocationID and the institutionCode.","Example) 5483AIM, 88963AREMP, WtR563EPA","String"
2,1,"Location",NA,"verbatimlocationID","A code or number that identifies a unique sampling location. A site is a stream segment with a fixed starting and ending location for sampling. Code will remain the same across all site visits.","Recommended best practice is to use the EPSG code of the SRS, if known. Otherwise use a controlled vocabulary for the name or code of the geodetic datum, if known. Otherwise use a controlled vocabulary for the name or code of the ellipsoid, if known. If none of these is known, use the value unknown","String"
2,3,"Location",NA,"verbatimLatitude","The verbatim original latitude of the Location. The coordinate ellipsoid, geodeticDatum, or full Spatial Reference System (SRS) for these coordinates should be stored in verbatimSRS and the coordinate system should be stored in verbatimCoordinateSystem.","For this dataset we use the botton of the reach as the location.","Numeric"
2,4,"Location",NA,"verbatimLongitude","The verbatim original longitude of the Location. The coordinate ellipsoid, geodeticDatum, or full Spatial Reference System (SRS) for these coordinates should be stored in verbatimSRS and the coordinate system should be stored in verbatimCoordinateSystem.","For this dataset we use the botton of the reach as the location.","Numeric"
2,5,"Location",NA,"verbatimWaterbody","The water body name from the original data set.","For this data set this field is often refered to as Stream Name.","String"
2,5,"Location",NA,"verbatimSRS","The ellipsoid, geodetic datum, or spatial reference system (SRS) upon which coordinates given in verbatimLatitude and verbatimLongitude, or verbatimCoordinates are based.",NA,"String"
2,7,"Location",NA,"StateProvince","The name of the next smaller administrative region than country (state, province, canton, department, region, etc.) in which the Location occurs.",NA,"String"
2,8,"Location",NA,"decimalLatitude","The geographic latitude (in decimal degrees, using the spatial reference system given in geodeticDatum) of the geographic center of a Location. Positive values are north of the Equator, negative values are south of it. Legal values lie between -90 and 90, inclusive.",NA,"Numeric"
2,9,"Location",NA,"decimalLongitude","The geographic longitude (in decimal degrees, using the spatial reference system given in geodeticDatum) of the geographic center of a Location.
