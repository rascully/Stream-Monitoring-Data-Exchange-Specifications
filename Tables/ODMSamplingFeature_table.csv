2,"verbatimlocationID","A code or number that identifies a unique sampling location. A site is a stream segment with a fixed starting and ending location for sampling. Code will remain the same across all site visits.","Recommended best practice is to use the EPSG code of the SRS, if known. Otherwise use a controlled vocabulary for the name or code of the geodetic datum, if known. Otherwise use a controlled vocabulary for the name or code of the ellipsoid, if known. If none of these is known, use the value unknown","String",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NA","NA"
